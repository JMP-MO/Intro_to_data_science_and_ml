# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning
* A range of notebooks to support an introduction to data science and machine learning workshop. 
* Additional files that we download / generate are also stored here to support live sessions.
* The notebooks include an `Open in Colab` button you can use to open the notebook in a Google Colab. This will require a google account.
* Alternitiveily a `requirements.txt` file has been included with the packages and versions required to replicate the environment.

### Notebook structure:
1. **Exploring tabular data.** This notebook explains some basic Data Science and Machine Learning context. We go on to learn how to get and explore tabular data. 
2. **Working with tabular data.** This notebook demonstrates how to preprocess data ready for machine learning. 
3. **Intro to machine learning - regression.** This notebook demonstrates how to use our preprocessed data to train a machine learning model. 
4. **Machine learning competition** - Vision Model MNIST!
