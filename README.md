# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning
* A range of notebooks to support an introduction to data science and machine learning workshop. 
* Additional files that we download / generate are also stored here to support live sessions.
* The notebooks include an `Open in Colab` button you can use to open the notebook in a Google Colab. This will require a google account.
* Alternitiveily a `requirements.txt` file has been included with the packages and versions required to replicate the environment.

### Notebook structure:
1. Intro to Data Science and Machine Learning and exploring tabular data
    1. Understand what data science is and some of the key areas such as machine learning.
    2. Able to get and load tabular data. 
    3. Use common techniques to explore tabular data.

2. Working with tabular data:
    1. How to identify and handle missing values. 
    2. How to identify and handle outlier values.
    3. How to encoding strings (categorical data).
    4. How to scale data (normalisation / standardisation).
    5. How to save your preprocessed data.

3. Intro to machine learning - regression
    1. How to load preprocessed data
    2. How and why we split our data
    3. Understand what overfitting and generalisation are in relation to machine learning. 
    4. How to convert data to numpy and why we do this. 
    5. Create a basic TensorFlow machine learning model architecture. 
    6. Experiment with some hyperparameters to train a machine learning model. 
    7. An understand of what loss is. 
    8. How to read a loss chart. 
    9. How to save a model.

4. 🏆 Machine learning competition - Vision Model MNIST!
